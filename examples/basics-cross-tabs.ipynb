It does so by comparing the observed frequencies (i.e., what we actually see in the data) to the expected frequencies (i.e., what we would expect to see if the two variables were independent). If there are big differences between the table of expected and observed frequencies, the chi-square value will be _large_. The chi-square value for each cell is calculated as $(o - e)^2 / e$, where $o$ is the observed frequency in a cell and $e$ is the expected frequency in that cell if the null hypothesis holds. These chi-square values can be shown by adding `output=\"chisq\"` as an argrument to the `.summary()` method of a `cross_tab` object. The overall chi-square value is obtained by summing the chi-square values across all cells, i.e., it is the sum of the values shown in the _Contribution to chi-squared_ table.\n",

As we can see from the output below, that value is 3.841 if we choose a 95% confidence level.
