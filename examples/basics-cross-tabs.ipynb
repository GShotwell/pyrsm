    "The (Pearson) chi-squared test evaluates if we can reject the null-hypothesis that the two variables are independent. It does so by comparing the observed frequencies (i.e., what we actually see in the data) to the expected frequencies (i.e., what we would expect to see if the two variables were independent). If there are big differences between the table of expected and observed frequencies, the chi-square value will be _large_. The chi-square value for each cell is calculated as $(o - e)^2 / e$, where $o$ is the observed frequency in a cell and $e$ is the expected frequency in that cell if the null hypothesis holds. These chi-square values can be shown by adding `output=\"chisq\"` as an argrument to the `.summary()` method of a `cross_tab` object. The overall chi-square value is obtained by summing the chi-square values across all cells, i.e., it is the sum of the values shown in the _Contribution to chi-squared_ table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine if the overall chi-square statistics can be considered _large_ we first determine the degrees of freedom (df). In particular: $df = (\\# rows - 1) \\times (\\# columns - 1)$. In a 2x2 table, we have $(2-1) \\times (2-1) = 1$ df. The output from `ct.summary()` shows the value of the chi-square statistic, the associated df, and the p.value associated with the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to check the expected values: All expected frequencies are larger than 5 therefore the p.value for the chi-square statistic is unlikely to be biased. As usual we reject the null-hypothesis when the p.value is smaller 0.05. Since our p.value is very small (< .001) we can reject the null-hypothesis (i.e., the data suggest there is an association between newspaper readership and income).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the provided p.value associated with the Chi-squared value of 187.783 to evaluate the null hypothesis. However, we can also calculate the critical Chi-squared value using the probability calculator in the Radiant R package. As we can see from the output below, that value is 3.841 if we choose a 95% confidence level. Because the calculated Chi-square value is larger than the critical value (187.783 > 3.841) we reject null hypothesis that `Income` and `Newspaper` are independent."

    "In addition to the numerical output provided by the `.summary()` method we can evaluate the hypothesis visually using the `.plot()` method of the `cross_tab` object. In addition to the distribution of observed and expected frequencies, we will also plot the standardized deviations (i.e., standardized differences between the observed and expected table). This measure is calculated as $(o-e)/sqrt(e)$, i.e., a score of how different the observed and expected frequencies in one cell in our table are. When a cell's standardized deviation is greater than 1.96 (in absolute value) the cell has a significant deviation from the model of independence (or no association)."

    "Now lets re-run the analysis using a web-based user interface. Select `Income` as the first categotical variable and `Newspaper` as the second. This test amounts to evaluating the size of the difference between the observed and expected frequencies.

    "Select `Observed`, `Expected`, and `Chi-squared` as the output tables to create. The (Pearson) chi-squared test evaluates if we can reject the null-hypothesis that the two variables are independent. It does so by comparing the observed frequencies (i.e., what we actually see in the data) to the expected frequencies (i.e., what we would expect to see if the two variables were independent). If there are big differences between the table of expected and observed frequencies, the chi-square value will be _large_. The chi-square value for each cell is calculated as $(o - e)^2 / e$, where $o$ is the observed frequency in a cell and $e$ is the expected frequency in that cell if the null hypothesis holds. These chi-square values can be shown by adding `output=\"chisq\"` as an argrument to the `summary()` method of a `cross_tab` object. The overall chi-square value is obtained by summing the chi-square values across all cells, i.e., it is the sum of the values shown in the _Contribution to chi-squared_ table.\n",
